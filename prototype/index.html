        <h2>All Aboard</h2>
        <p>The ship carrying almost 2000 passengers to the Bahamas would set sail from the <strong>The Port of Miami</strong>, with my familyâ€™s focus primarily being to celebrate 64 years of life and love.<blockquote>May your adventures bring you closer together, even as they take you far away from home<cite>Trenton Lee Stewart</cite> </blockquote></p>

          <h3>The Journey</h3>
          <p>Our journey actually began December 2019, with the initial purchase of our cruise set to sail March 2020.  However, as you all may know life for everyone cam to a screeching halt amid Covid-19.  As time progressed, things began to reopen, vaccinations were made availalbe; we were finally able to set sail August 2022 just in time for my moms birthday.  Because my mom was not too fond of going from plane to boat, we opted to drive from Little, AR to Miami, FL for a total of 18 hours.  Once we made it to our port in Miami we set sail for a three day adventure with one day at sea and one stop in Nassau, Bahamas before heading back to Miami, FL
